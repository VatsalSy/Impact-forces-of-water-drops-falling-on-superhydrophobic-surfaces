# Impact-forces-of-water-drops-falling-on-superhydrophobic-surfaces
This repository contains the codes used for simulating the cases discussed in the manuscript: Impact forces of water drops falling on superhydrophobic surfaces. The results presented here are currently under review in Physical Review Letters.


Please note that in this repository, we use the radius of the drop as the length scale to calculate the dimensionless numbers, whereas in the paper we use diameter of drop.
